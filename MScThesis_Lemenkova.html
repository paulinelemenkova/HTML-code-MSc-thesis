The seagrasses, a unique group of aquatic plants growing submerged in the sea water, with root-like structures (rhizoms) buried in the sediments and vertical elongate leaves. Being a flowering plant, completely adapted to marine environment, they are however, more closely related to the lily family (Liliaceae) than to  true grass, despite their name “seagrass”, caused by the ribbon-like, grassy leaves (<a href="#McKenzie, 2008">McKenzie, 2008</a>). Seagrasses create unique, complex, extremely diversified and productive ecological systems in the littoral coastal zones between 0-50 meters in shallow waters all over the world (<a href="#Hogarth, 2007">Hogarth, 2007</a>), and serve as a valuable environmental indicators for the marine ecosystems health. Seagrasses are closely connected and linked with complex interactions to other vegetation types, e.g. mangroves, coral reefs, etc. Being important constructing component of littoral ecosystems, seagrass contributes significantly to their structure and functioning. 
The adaptation to the salt waters is evidently influenced the global ditribution of the seagrasses, limiting it to shallow coastal areas. <br> 
A number of critical conditions determines grouth of seagrass, including general climatic characteristics of the area, i.e.temperature, day length, geological and geomorphological conditions, e.g. soft type of sediments (sand or mud), shallow depths, as well as chemical and physical parameters of the water: salinity, waves (<a href="#McKenzie and Campbell, 2002">McKenzie and Campbell, 2002</a>).  
The seagrass Posidonia oceanica (further P. oceanica)  is a key species to inhabit littoral of the Mediterranean Sea (Fig.1). and is widely spread along the coasts of Crete (<a href="#Dumay, 2002">Dumay, 2002</a>). It plays an important role in a number of geomorphological and ecological processes. Namely, it is a source of food for herbivorous fauna as well as helter zones for fish and other marine organisms; it contributes to the nutrient recycling; it provides sediments stability by reducing the degree of water movements, etc (<a href="#Francour et al, 1999">Francour et al, 1999</a>). 
The purpose of this MSc research work is to apply methods of the remote sensing (RS) and GIS towards mapping and monitoring of P. oceanica meadows along the Cretan coasts, Greece. 
The current research aims to apply methods of remote sensing including satellite, aerial photos and videometric underwater imaging as well as GIS-based spatial analysis for the environmental monitoring of P. oceanica. The technical implementation is based on ENVI, Erdas Imagine, WASI and ArcGIS software using aerial and satellite images as well as results of the underwater videometric measurements.

<p><b><h1 id="1.2. Background">1.2.	Background</p></b></h1>
<p><b><h1 id="1.2.1. Global distribution of the seagrasses">1.2.1. Global distribution of the seagrasses</p></b></h1>
Globally, there are 58 recognized and described seagrass species (Fig.1.2), belonging to two orders (Hydrocharitales and Najadales), four families (Hydrocharitaceae, Posidoniaceae, Cymodoceaceae and Zosteraceae), and 12 genera (Enhalus, Thalassia, Halophila, Posidonia, Syringodium, Halodule, Cymodocea, Amphibolis, Thalassodendron, Zostera, Heterozostera and Phyllospandix) (<a href="#Kuo and McComb, 1989">Kuo and McComb, 1989</a>). 
The distribution of the seagrasses is strongly influensed by several environmental factors, which include climate (mostly, tropical and temperate areas), bathymetry (shallow shelf zones), hydrological particularities (chemical content of water, nutritient availability and turbidity of waves), and geological characteristics - sedimentation and cover types of the seafloor (<a href="#McKenzie et al, 2006">McKenzie et al, 2006</a>).
There are four European seagrass species in Mediterranean area (<a href="#Borum et al, 2004">Borum et al, 2004</a>): Zostera marina, Zostera noltii, Cymodocea nodosa and P. oceanica. In Greece the common species are P.oceanica (L.) Delile, Cymodocea nodosa (Ucria) Ascherson, Zostera noltii Hornemann and Halophila stipulacea (<a href="#Amoutzopoulou-Schina and Haritonidis, 2005">Amoutzopoulou-Schina and Haritonidis, 2005</a>). These species differ in morphological and phenological features (Fig.1.3.) as well as in structure and dynamics. Thus, Cymodocea nodosa is considered the pioneer species of P. oceanica beds, the latter species forming the last stage. When P. oceanica beds regresses, C. nodosa often replaces them (<a href="#Den Hartog, 1977">Den Hartog, 1977</a>); as a result, P. oceanica, C. nodosa, and Z. noltii do not form mixed persistent stands (<a href="#Buia and Mazzella, 1991">Buia and Mazzella, 1991</a>). 
<p><b><h1 id="1.2.2. Ecological significance of the seagrasses">1.2.2. Ecological significance of the seagrasses</p></b></h1>
Seagrass plays vital role in the marine ecosystems of the world ocean. Seagrasses are the only flowering plant in the world that is able to live completely submerged. Seagrass is a habitat for numerous marine species (<a href="#Nagelkerken et al, 2000">Nagelkerken et al, 2000</a>), source of primary production and food for fish, turtles and other marine organisms, which gives them special environmental characteristics and value (<a href="#Noralez, 2010">Noralez, 2010</a>). 
Seagrass meadows produce enormous quantities of organic matter (leaves, epiphytes), which constitutes the basis of the food web both within and outside the ecosystem (<a href="#Gobert et al, 2006">Gobert et al, 2006</a>). Finally, seagrasses are an important component in the environmental "food chain" of the coastal ecosystems, being the food source for dugongs, turtles, swans and various fish (<a href="#Cappo et al, 1995">Cappo et al, 1995</a>). <br>
Due to their wide distribution, meadows size, easy collection and abundance, sensitivity to the modifications of the coastal zone and their important role in maintaining coastal water quality and clarity, seagrass is perfect indicator and descriptor of the environmental health of  marine ecosystems, and is highly suitable for the environmental monitoring (<a href="#Pergent-Martini et al, 2005">Pergent-Martini et al, 2005)</a>. Being often confused with marine “algae”, “seagrasses” are vastly different from them. There are fundamental differences between both marine organisms, the major of them should be briefly mentioned: first, seagrasses are true plants with root system and leaves which photosynthesise, have complex structure and create landscape-similar vast formations on the colonised seafloor areas with soft sediment, whereas algae are simple organisms that can only holdfast; secondly, seagrasses are complex vascular plants with reproductive mechanism such as fruits, seeds and spores, while algae have simple few cell structure with spores and gametes; finally, seagrasses uptake nutrient through root system, while algae nourish directly from the water column (<a href="#Dixon, 2005">Dixon, 2005</a>). There are other differences between “seagrass” and “algae” but they go beyond the scope of this work. <br>
<p><b><h1 id="1.2.3. Environmental vulnerability of the seagrasses">1.2.3. Environmental vulnerability of the seagrasses </p></b></h1>
Meadows of P. oceanica are subjected to the human activities, as they occur in coastal areas, where they can be affected both directly (<a href="#Meinesz et al, 1991">Meinesz et al, 1991</a>) or indirectly, through the impact on the quality of waters and sediments (<a href="#Duarte, 2002">Duarte, 2002</a>). As P. oceanica is a long-living plant with a slow growth rate, the anthropogenic modifications of the coastal zone, happening more rapidly than the capacity of the plant to adapt to these changes, reduce its distribution area (<a href="#Micheli et al, 2005">Micheli et al, 2005</a>). One of the main drivers of seagrass decline is, for instance, the location of the fish farming near the seagrass meadows. The negative effects of the sedimentation of waste particles in the farm vicinities on P. oceanica meadows are diverse and complex, and may cause benthic deterioration, accumulation of organic matter and seagrass decline (<a href="#Holmer et al, 2008">Holmer et al, 2008</a>). The detailed research of the fish farm-induced decline of the seagrass meadows (<a href="#Diaz-Almela et al, 2006">Diaz-Almela et al, 2006</a>) reports the relationships of fish farm organic and nutrient content in the sediments with dynamics of the key seagrass species (P. oceanica) in the Mediterranean Sea. Nowadays P.oceanica is in the alarming state of regression due to the deterioration of the environment in the Mediterranean Sea (<a href="#Ribed, 2002">Ribed, 2002</a>). Due to these reasons, P. oceanica is a protected species since 1988 in some European countries (<a href="#Francour et al, 1999">Francour et al, 1999</a>), and its presence serves as an indicator of a stable healthy environment. Among other negative factors, affecting both growth and status of the seagrasses  the environmental contaminants can be mentioned, e.g. thermal, sewage, dredging and chemical pollution as well as any other kind of maritime works, e.g. trawling and anchoring of boats (<a href="#Ribed, 2002">Ribed, 2002</a>). Other human activities that cause degrading of the seagrass are recreational boating, commertial overexploitation of coastal resources, eutrophication (<a href="#McKenzie et al, 2006">McKenzie et al, 2006</a>).<br>
Besides anthropogenic factors, various biochemical, climatic and environmental processes can cause negative influence on seagrass distribution. Seagrass is exposed to threats from the global climate and environmental change, i.e. increases in sea surface temperature; sea level rise; increased frequency and intensity of storms and waves; local decrease of water quality, increased sedimentation, contaminantion and nutrification; desiccation; salinity fluctuations; nutrient changes; suspended sediments (<a href="#Blake et al, 2000">Blake et al, 2000</a>). These stress-drivers can alone result in large-scale seagrass degradation, but often seagrass undergo simultaneous affects from several of these factors together. This naturally increase environmental pressing and leads to drastical loss of very large areas of seagrass globally (<a href="#Orth et al, 2006">Orth et al, 2006</a>). <br>
In tropical areas, where most of seagrasses are located (Fig.1.4.), seagrasses are subject to catastrophic extinction and loss, due to the cyclones, typhoons, storms, regular floods and increased rainfalls. Recovery from such events can take up to several years and often it is only possible by means of the seed reserves from the local environmental surveys (<a href="#McKenzie and Yoshida, 2007">McKenzie and Yoshida, 2007</a>). Other threats for seagrasses in tropical areas are increased nutrient availability in the coastal zones, increased eutrophication and invasive macroalgae. These processes have strong affect on the status of the seagrass meadows, and often lead to their complete disappearance (<a href="#Holmer et al, 2009">Holmer et al, 2009</a>). Seagrasses are subject to anthropogenic nutrient (N and P) loading, which may occasionally casue morphological (e.g. leaf length) and physiological (e.g. chlorophyll and nitrogen content of the leaves) responses towards changed environmental conditions (<a href="#Leoni et al, 2006">Leoni et al, 2006</a>; <a href="#Leoni et al, 2007">Leoni et al, 2007</a>). Other environmental threat for the seagrasses arise as a result of the environmental struggle and competition for existence among species. Thus, meadows of P.oceanica in the Mediterranean Sea are presently facing invasion by alien algal species, partuicularly in areas where P.oceanica is already degrading, stressed, have gaps and patchy structure in meadows and show other signs of regression (<a href="#Montefalcone et al, 2010">Montefalcone et al, 2010</a>).
Seagrasses are vulnerable fragile species, important for the marine coastal ecosystems, especially for the protection of the beach structure. However, the facts about seagrass global degrading sound worrying: about 54 % of the total seagrass meadows have lost any part of their area; the areas, where the seagrass ecosystems are degrading or lost, are not located in a specific area or continent, but registered globally; since 1980s global losses of the seagrases on our planet is equal to two footbal fields per hour  (<a href="#Mellors and McKenzie, 2009b">Mellors and McKenzie, 2009b</a>). 
<p><b><h1 id="1.2.4. General characteristics of  Posidonia oceanica">1.2.4. General characteristics of  Posidonia oceanica</p></b></h1>
The endemic Mediterranean seagrass Posidonia oceanica (further P. oceanica), is a main species in marine coastal environment of Greece, forming, despite its slow growth, the largest, most widespread, homogeneous and dense meadows in the Mediterranean between 5 and 40 m depth (<a href="#Den Hartog, 1970">Den Hartog, 1970</a>). 
The dominant and most productive coastal ecosystem of the Mediterranean, P.oceanica is spatially restricted to the Mediterranean area (Fig.1.4.), with its extention limited by the western part of the Mediterranean Sea where cold Atlantic waters enter Gibraltar and mix with warm Mediterranean waters, thus decreasing its temperature. 
Morphological P.oceanica consists of long, 5-12 mm broad, “hairy-like” leaves, 3-4 mm thick roots and short rhizomes (0.5-2.0 mm). The leaves are, perhaps, the most particular characteristics of P.oceanica, making it highly recognizable and distinguishable from other seagrasses (Fig.1.5): having usual length of 20-40 cm, in some cases they can reach up to 1 m (<a href="#Borum et al, 2004">Borum et al, 2004</a>). 
Growing P.oceanica make a meadows which, in turn, consisnt of smaller patches, called “matte” (Fig.1.6), a monumental construction made by the growth of rhizomes and leaves with entangled roots and entrapped sediment (<a href="#Francour et al, 2006">Francour et al, 2006</a>). 
Representing one of the most productive Mediterranean ecosystems, P. oceanica usually serves as a perfect biological indicator for the assessment of the quality of waters and environmental health (<a href="#Boudouresque et al, 1989">Boudouresque et al, 1989</a>). Some authors (<a href="#Guidetti, 2008">Guidetti, 2008</a>, <a href="#Montefalcone, 2009">Montefalcone, 2009</a>) used status and population dynamics of P. oceanica as indicators for the evaluation of the meadow health status. 

There are several environmental factors, determinating the growth of the P. oceanica. The  adaptation to dry-summer subtropical climate reduces its extention to  Mediterranean area only (Fig. 1.4.). Besides, the distribution of the seagrasses changes with water depth: it is noticed (Dural, 2010) that the highest flowering density is usually in the 4-7 m depth. P. oceanica flowers appeared in shallow stands in September while in November only in stands deeper than 15 m. This time delay is caused by the different maximum summer temperatures at those depths (<a href="#Buia and Mazzella, 1991">Buia and Mazzella, 1991</a>). 
The phenology of P. oceanica is also affected by the coastal bathymetry: in the isolated meadows in shallow waters plants have shorter and falciform leaves, compared to ones in the deeper and central areas (<a href="#Dural, 2010">Dural, 2010</a>). In P. oceanica flower abundance is related to the structure of the meadow with the maximal flower density in the densest stands, while the occurrence of flowering is regulated by environmental factors (<a href="#Buia and Mazzella, 1991">Buia and Mazzella, 1991</a>). Phenology of the P. oceanica undergo modifications with varying seasons during the year: during the flowering period (ca 3 months long) the number of leaves on the flowering shoots decrease. Changes of the leaf growth also appear in the flowering shoots with longer oldest leaves and shorter and narrower leaves induced during the flowering (<a href="#Gobert et al, 2001">Gobert et al, 2001</a>).
<p><b><h1 id="1.3. Research problem">1.3. Research problem</p></b></h1>
Monitoring of the marine benthic ecosystems of seagrasses is essential for the environmental assessment of the coastal zones. It increases our knowledge of the seagrass  ecology, highlightes threats to the seagrass and preventing them from possible losses and degrading and improves techniques and methods of the underwater-based observations. Mapping the seagrass contributes to the evaluating of the seagrass current distribution, analysis of its dynamics and changes over time, as well as estimations of the degrading of seagrass meadows for the purpose of the coastal management.
Precise, correct and up-to-date information about the distribution of P. oceanica is necessary for the sustainable conservation of the marine environment and ecosystems in Mediterranean area, being an important contribution  to the environmental coastal zone management (<a href="#Pergent-Martini et al, 2006">Pergent-Martini et al, 2006</a>). However, mapping the sesgrass has limitations due to the specific location and characteristics of the research object. The remote sensing techniques have traditionally been widely used for the seagrass monitoring. The general overview of the application of various remote sensing data types (colour, infrared, and black & white images) for the seagrass monitoring shows its high suitability and potential as a research method  (<a href="#Pasqualini et al, 2001">Pasqualini et al, 2001</a>, <a href="#Matarrese et al, 2006">Matarrese et al, 2006</a>;). The using of the aerial photographs as base maps for the seagrass meadows mapping is, perhaps, the most traditional application (<a href="#McKenzie, 2003">McKenzie, 2003</a>, <a href="#Kendrick et al, 2000">Kendrick et al, 2000</a>; <a href="#Pasqualini et al, 1999">Pasqualini et al, 1999</a>). The results of the image processing of colour aerial photographs for the monitoring of littoral environment with seagrass beds have been reported by several authors (<a href="#Kelly, 1980">Kelly, 1980</a>; <a href="#Walker, 1989">Walker, 1989</a>; <a href="#Green et al, 1996">Green et al, 1996</a>). 
Satellite imagery processing has also being used for the seagrass monitoring, due to their accuracy, repeatability and informativeness as a source of data (<a href="#Dekker et al, 2005b">Dekker et al, 2005b</a>), enabling regular temporal coverage over the large remote areas and providing a cost-effective approach for the mapping of the remotely located feature, such as underwater vegetation (<a href="#Jensen et al, 1995">Jensen et al, 1995</a>). Satellite images provide with detailed information on seagrass canopy and other environmental indicators (<a href="#Fyfe, 2003">Fyfe, 2003</a>). 
Various research papers report successful application of the image processing for the seagrass mapping (<a href="#Calvo et al, 2003">Calvo et al, 2003</a>; <a href="#Dekker et al, 2005">Dekker et al, 2005</a>; <a href="#Fornes et al, 2006">Fornes et al, 2006</a>; <a href="#Green et al, 1996">Green et al 1996</a>;  <a href="#Jackson and Nemeth, 2007">Jackson and Nemeth, 2007</a>; <a href="#Jensen et al, 1995">Jensen et al, 1995</a>; <a href="#Kendrick et al, 2000">Kendrick et al, 2000</a>; <a href="#Lyzenga, 1981">Lyzenga, 1981</a>; <a href="#Malthus and Karpouzli, 2003">Malthus & Karpouzli, 2003</a>; <a href="#Matarrese et al, 2008">Matarrese et al, 2008</a>; <a href="#Mount, 2003">Mount, 2003</a>; <a href="#Pasqualini et al, 2001">Pasqualini et al, 2001</a>; <a href="#Pasqualini et al, 1999">Pasqualini et al, 1999</a>; <a href="#Pasqualini et al, 1998a">Pasqualini et al, 1998a</a>; <a href="#Pergent-Martini et al, 2006">Pergent-Martini et al, 2006</a>; <a href="#Ralph et al, 2005">Ralph et al, 2005</a>; <a href="#Ribed, 2002">Ribed, 2002</a>; <a href="#Short and Coles, 2001">Short and Coles, 2001</a>; <a href="#Walker, 1989">Walker, 1989</a>). 
The application of the remote sensing data towards seagrass mapping is based on the spectral reflectance characteristics of the P. oceanica seagrass, which enable its spectral discrimination from spectra of other seafloor types. It is proved (<a href="#Thorhaug et al, 2007">Thorhaug et al, 2007</a>) that the spectral signatures of different species of tropical seagrasses are well distinguishable from each other. The application of the methods of images classification for seagrass mapping is based on the classifying the pixels on the image according to their spectral reflectance values (<a href="#Fornes et al, 2006">Fornes et al, 2006</a>), so that the seafloor can be divided into several types: sand, rock, P. oceanica, other vegetation, etc. 
Other example of monitoring of P. oceanica using remote sensing techniques (<a href="#Calvo et al, 2003">Calvo et al, 2003</a>) reports the application of the CZCS images towards the case study of the Italian coast  and shows successful results of the neural-based classification using Isodata method of supervised classification. In case of P. oceanica meadows aerial and satellite images are particularly suited for the surveying shallow waters (<a href="#Pasqualini et al, 1998b">Pasqualini et al, 1998b</a>) enabling to distinguish seagrass formations and dynamics of the temporal evolution of seagrass meadows over the research area (<a href="#Pasqualini et al, 2001">Pasqualini et al, 2001</a>). 
However, using space borne satellite imagery for the seagrass mapping has certain limitations, due to the uncertainties of the spectral signature of the seagrass at higher depths (Fig. 1.8.), as well as some optical particularities, e.g. light refraction under water, unevenness of the water surface, depths, etc. Some problems can also arise in the images interpretations, as quite different objects may have similar spectral reflectance, e.g. seagrass, dark-coloured bottom patches (mud), macroalgae. 
The in-situ fieldwork including underwater videographic measurements is an important part of the seagrass monitoring, and has been successfully applied towards seagrass mapping (<a href="#Haag et al, 2008">Haag et al, 2008</a>). The underwater measurements are used to validate the results and to receive detailed, accurate and precise data for the selected locations. The underwater measurements cannot be applied for the whole research area, however it provides with detailed monitoring along the  route of the boat. Therefore, in the selected locations it becomes a useful tool for the assessment of the distribution, density and coverage of the seagrass along the tracklog. Besides, the underwater observations using scuba diving equipment have been conducted for the measurements of depths.
<p><b><h1 id="1.4. Research objective">1.4.	Research objective</p></b></h1>

A statistical testing will be used to compare between the spectral responses of the different seagrass types, whether it is spectrally distinct and at least one pair is statistically different at every spectral band. 
Hypothesis Ho: seagrass types are not spectrally distinct  from other seafloor types with varying in-situ conditions, which means 
Ho: µ1 =µ2 =µ3=...= µn.
The alternative Hypothesis Ha claims the opposite statement: seagrass is spectrally distinct with varying in-situ conditions, Ho: µ1?µ2?µ3?...? µn.
The distribution of the spectral responses at every spectral band is assumed to be normal as well as the equality of the statistical variances. 
The hypothesis testing is suggested to be carried out using the ANOVA statistical test. The purpose of ANOVA test is to visualize in an effective and quick way the spectral differences between seagrass species and their spatial distribution. Thus, the key hypotheses of the research will be tested to prove whether the results of the research are accurate, reasonable and correct.

Seagrass consistent monitoring and mappint is necessary and important for the sustainable coastal development and conservation measures. Earlier, many seagrass meadows have been destroyed by human activities in the coastal zone, mainly due to the ignorance of their existence, because information on the seagrass bed exact location was not available (<a href="#Choo, 2006">Choo, 2006</a>). Well-time seagrass observations and mapping enables precise control of its spatial distribution, detection of any changes in the seagrass landscapes, highlightes potential environmental threats in the coastal zone (e.g. declining of meadows) before they become unmanageable for the coastal management services. Choosing the right and most effective approach method for the seagrass monitoring is essential. Remote sensing methods alone, though having evident advantages, are insufficient, because satellite images of underwater habitats are notoriously difficult to identify and interpret. The best research method should be based on the integrated approach, well described in various scientific works (<a href="#Brown et al, 2002">Brown et al, 2002</a>; <a href="#Montefalcone et al, 2006">Montefalcone et al, 2006</a>; <a href="#Kirkman, 1996">Kirkman, 1996</a>), which includes combination of various techniques of the seagrass monitoring, i.e. remote sensing imagery classification of aerial and satellite
images, GIS-based spatial analysis and ground in-situ surveys.
Seagrass can be mapped using various approaches, with the most popular method of the remote sensing, enabling to detect the substratum and vegetation types growing on the sea floor. Comparing to the analysis of the terrestrial plants, aquatic vegtation cannot be detected using red edge of the spectrum, as these wavelengths are significantly absorbed by water (<a href="#Kirk, 1994">Kirk, 1994</a>), as well as by spectral scattering and absorption by phytoplankton. Some remote methods of seagrass mapping use active hydroacoustic sonar sensors that send towards a sea floor a signal of energy and then collect the return echoes for the analysis. Yet this method requires specialised equipment and is mostly used in the depth waters, for the bathymetric measurements. 
The current study is based on the application of the remote sensing data, broadband satellite imagery, aerial images and the results of the underwater videographic measurements towards seagrass
mapping. Image classification is based on the principle of the differentiation between the spectral signatures of various seafloor cover types. The spectrum of light coming up from the ocean surface in
shallow waters keeps information on the optical properties of the seawater components and benthic substrate which can be read from their spectral signatures (<a href="#Werdell and Roesler, 2003">Werdell and Roesler, 2003</a>). Spectral
reflectances, distinct for each seafloor cover type, enable their discrimination on the image. The pre-processing stage includes imagery corrections for atmospheric noises and effects of the water column. Reflectance spectra of the seagrass canopy at different depths of the water-column are analysed for the discrimination of their spectral signatures enabling to separate various seafloor types while images classification. The results of the of imagery classification are analysed for the detection of long term dynamics in P. oceanica seagrass distribution along the coasts of Crete. Aerial imagery from Google Earth with high spatial resolution, suitable for the large-scale detailed mapping of seagrass mattes, is used for the improvement of the accuracy of large seagrass meadows and separate mattes within the meadows. The in situ underwater videometric measurements of the seafloor are collected during the fieldwork in Crete, for the validation of the classification results and to determine the exact current distribution of the P. oceanica meadows. 
The image processing includes steps of the remote sensing techniques, i.e. calibration, masking from land and cloud, atmospheric correction, sea surface glint and depth effects correction as recommended (Matarrese et al). During the image classification working step the training sites for the supervised classification methods are designed, as well as its control and trials of different classification approaches (Unsupervised, K-means or Isodata; Supervised, Maximum Likelihood).

<h1 id="2.1. Seagrass global monitoring: history and perspectives"><p><b>2.1. Seagrass global monitoring: history and perspectives</h1></p></b>
Mapping and monitoring the seagrass is important for the environmental assessment of the marine ecosystemsn in coastal areas. Regular tracking of current distribution of seagrass meadows, based on correct information and cartographic visualization of seagrasses, is a preventive environmental management, which helps to analyse potential environmental risks of coastal areas, decrease of the number of species, loss of meadows and patches of the seagrasses. The tradition of global seagrass mapping though has not a very long history comparing to the terrestrial cartography, due to the technical difficulties of underwater observations, yet nowadays is has become a successful, rapidly developping, increasingly popular and challenging research branch. 
Several global seagrass surveys organise and provide regular monitoring of the segrass distribution, health and species sustainability, amongst which the most world-known are, perhaps, the following ones: <a href="http://www.seagrassnet.org/">Global Seagrass Monitoring project</a>, <a href="http://www.seagrasswatch.org/">Seagrasswatch</a>, located in Australia, <a href="http://mediterranean.seagrassonline.org/">the Mediterranean association Seagrass-2000</a>, <a href="http://www.imedea.uib.es/index.php">the Mediterranean Institute for Advanced Studies</a>, <a href="http://www2.fiu.edu/~seagrass/">Seagrass Ecosystems Research Laboratory in South Florida</a>, <a href="http://www.flseagrass.org/">Florida Seagrass organisation</a>,<a href="http://www.seagrasses.org/">the Seagrasses.org</a> and the <a href="http://wsa.seagrassonline.org/">World Seagrass Association</a>. These organizations aim at global seagrass monitoring, providing with research results and reporting guidelines and manuals with standartized methods and recommendations, specific for the seagrass research and monitoring. There are also university marine centres and research institutes conducting seagrass monitoring and as a particular part of their research. Their reports and guidelines were used for references in the current research. 
Regular obserbvations and monitoring of the seagrasses are known since 1960s, mainly in tropical regions (Australia). Since that time traditional methods of the seagrass monitoring and common recommendations have been developped. The development of the underwater SCUBA diving equipment and devices enabled to conduct underwater detailed measurements and observations largely contributed to the improvement of the traditional in-situ observations of seagrass. From the other side, development of the remote sensing methods and data acquisition from space contributed to the new methods of seagrass mapping, using distance approach and generally based on images classification. 
<h1 id="2.2. In-situ observations of the seagrass meadows"><p><b>2.2. In-situ observations of the seagrass meadows</p></b></h1>
The traditional methods of seagrass monitoring include in general the following standard scheme (<a href="#McKenzie, 2003">McKenzie, 2003</a>). The seagrass is being sampled on the selected sites using transect lines, quadrant frame, single point markers, markers, GPS and other equipment. The seagrass sampling is taken on the regular way with observation polints covering the study area with normal distribution. During the measurement process, the vertical photograph of the measurements frame is taken, and the following points are traditionally estimated:  percentage of the seagrass cover withing the quadrate, species composition, sediment composition, canopy height, epyphyte abundance, algae percent cover, count of microfauna and a specimen of seagrass is being taken. This scheme is used among the marine biologists and seagrass researchers (<a href="#McKenzie et al, 2003">McKenzie et al, 2003</a>). 
Applications of the in-situ seagrass observations of the structuring epiphyte community composition in the P.oceanica ecosystems in Mediterranean Sea is, for example,
described by <a href="#Villegas, 2006">Villegas (2006)</a> Realization of traditional methods for mapping seagrass usually involves intensive and time-consuming in-situ observations during the fieldwork, as, for example,
reported by <a href="#Iverson and Bittaker, 1986">Iverson and Bittaker (1986)</a>. Other methods of seagrass in-situ monitoring are based on using the active hydroacoustic sonar sensors that send towards a sea floor a signal of energy and then collect the return echoes for the analysis, yet this requires specialised equipment and is mostly used in
the depth waters, combined with bathymetric measurements. Another limitation of the acoustic techniques is that they are not effective at identifying the composition or even the presence of
submerged aquatic vegetation such as seagrasses and seaweeds (<a href="#Werdell and Roesler, 2003">Werdell and Roesler, 2003</a>), because initially acoustic methods were intended for the bathymetric surveying, i.e. they are not adjusted for the benthic habitat discrimination. The results of the in-situ measurements and observation are usually
managed and treated using integrated GIS approach, as, for example, reported by <a href="#Schmieder, 1997">Schmieder (1997)</a>.
<h1 id="2.3. Measuring water optical properties: hyperspectral radiometers"><p><b>2.3. Measuring water optical properties: hyperspectral radiometers</h1></p></b>
The application of the remote sensing data for seagrass mapping is based on our knowledge of the spectral reflectance properties of the target objects, and using it for the classification of these objects on the image. In case of seagrasses it is spectral reflectance of the seafloor cover types, which can be analysed using measurements of optical properties of sea water: radiance and irradiance. 
Optical remote sensing methods can get through the clear waters to approximately 15–30 m (<a href="#Mumby et al, 2004">Mumby et al, 2004</a>). Light entering is strongly dependent on wavelengths, e.g. it is greater in blue wavelengths (400 nm) than in others, and on the optical and physical properties of the water, e.g. concentration of suspended particles, chlorofill, coloured dissolved organic matter (gelbstoff), etc (<a href="#Ackleson, 2003">Ackleson, 2003</a>).
The optical properties of the sea water vary with different environmental conditions and reflect current chemical content and physical specifics of the water, revealing the variability and distribution of color of the sea waters, determined by the material in the water, e.g. chlorophyll, as well as its physical properties, e.g. water absorption, attenuation, backscattering (<a href="#Maffione, 2001b">Maffione, 2001b</a>). Besides, coastal waters, generally contain more dissolved substances and suspended particles, which directly influnces the transparency and colour of the waters of shelf zones (<a href="#Jerlov, 1952">Jerlov, 1952</a>). 
Being highly dynamic environments, coastal waters experience a variety of processes which alter their optical properties incessantly. The effects of these processes influence application of the hyperspectral remote sensing and reinforce other proceses (<a href="#Maffione, 2001b">Maffione, 2001b</a>). Thus, waves and tides, increase
sedimentation processes which in turn may change microrelief properties and topology. The optical properties of the water are best reflected in the values of its radiance and irradiance, which can be converted into spectral reflectance, or reflectivity. The spectral irradiance (E) is a radiant flux of the electromagnetic solar radiation energy, received per surface unit area in a given time (W·m?2·nm?1), while radiance (L) characterizes total emission or reflection that passes through or is emitted from a particular area (W·sr?1·m?2 ·nm?1). Therefore, the spectral reflectance, or the reflectivity of the object, can be estimated by the direct mathematical division of these first two characteristics, and is expressed in persentage (%).  
Therefore, the irradiance and radiance of the water should be measured in order to estimate spectral reflectance of the various seafloor cover types. The optical measurements of the irradiance and radiance of the sea water and bottom cover types of the seafloor can be received by the means of the optical sensors spectroradiometers. There are several companies producing radiometers with various characteristics and adjusted for defferent purposes, e.g. portable and miniature spectrometers from <a href="http://www.stellarnet.us">StellarNet</a>, Hyperspectral Ocean Colour Radiometer (HyperOCR) sensor by <a href="http://www.satlantic.com">Satlantic</a>, traceable spectroradiometers by <a href="http://www.orboptronix.com">Orbotronix</a> and lots of others. Among other radiometers there are ones designed by the <a href="http://www.trios.de/">Trios</a> company producing optical sensors, GER-Series Field portable spectroradiometers from SpectraPartners (http://www.spectrapartners.nl/), etc. Trios-RAMSES hyperspectral radiometers (Trios-RAMSES Hyperspectral UVA/UVB Irradiance Sensor and RAMSES-ARC Hyperspectral UV-VIS Radiance Sensor) are small-sized, low power-consumpting, flexible for fieldwork yet with high level of precision, specially calibrated for air and for water application as well as colour measurements  (Fig.2.3 and 2.4). These products have been used for the radiance and irradiance measurements in Agia Pelagia bay, Crete island, 2009.
<h1 id="2.4. Application of remote sensing data towards seagrass mapping"><p><b>2.4. Application of remote sensing data towards seagrass mapping</p></b></h1>
Various methods and approaches have been applied towards mapping of the seagrasses, based on digitized aerial photographs, GPS data, remote sensing and SCUBA-based fieldwork measurements.
SCUBA-based in-situ observations, though providing high resolution and accuracy results in seagrass mapping, is limited in application, because of their time consumption, weather-dependancy and
unsuitability for the case of monitoring large areas of water for small-scale mapping. Methods of underwater videography with GPS is a tool of seagrass monitoring which has certain advantages, i.e. high spatial and visual resolution, non-destructive sampling, effectiveness at all depths and rapid data collection in the field (<a href="#Schultz, 2007">Schultz, 2007</a>). However, it cannot cover large areas for small-scale mapping.
Remote sensing techniques offer clear advantages over other methods of in-situ field measurements and seagrass observations, mentioned above. Preference of the remote sensing methods consists in their weather-independency, cost-effectiveness, accuracy and spatial coverage, which enables periodic monitoring of the seagrass mewdoes and gives access to the distant and unapproachable
areas. Integrated together with GIS vector layers and maps, remote sensing data enable historical mapping (<a href="#Carter et al, 2009">Carter et al, 2009</a>; <a href="#Ardizzone et al, 2006">Ardizzone et al, 2006</a>) and assessment of change detection. However, application of the remote sensing techniques for mapping of submerged vegetation, seafloor cover types and benthic vegetation, inter alia seagrasses, are still in their development.
Approaches and methods for seagrass protection and monitoring still remain location specific or, at least, nation specific, depending to large extent on the tools available for researchers (<a href="#Mellors and McKenzie 2009a">Mellors and McKenzie 2009a</a>). Universal, international, standardised methods for seagrass directly for seagrasses
as such still should be developed. Various case studies have been performed, yet their mostly report methods adjusted for particular areas, without evaluating starndard general algorithms that could be extrapolated towards other regions. Application of the remote sensing towards seagrass mapping is generally based on the assumption that various types of the seafloor bottom have different characteristics of the reflectivity, which is visually expressed in distinct colors of the objects. In its
turn, reflectivity of the sediments is affected by the water optical properties and content. For example, <a href="#Stephens et al, 2003">Stephens et al (2003)</a> prove that microalgal biomass and community structure affect hyperspectral reflectance of sediments, which enable to estimate total microalgal biomass from measurements of hyperspectral reflectance.Spectral measurements of the target objects are made my the means of the radiometers, which receive and register the amounts of enegry (radiance and irradiance) from the objects. Measurement data of optical properties of water allow to calculate spectra of the objects and to well discriminate them on the aerial and satellite images. 
Thus, various scientists report success in spectral discrimination of submerged vegetation and other seafloor cover types on imagery using hyperspectral optical properties of the sea water for the assessment of benthic habitats (<a href="#Lewis, 2001">Lewis, 2001</a>; <a href="#Louchard et al, 2003">Louchard et al, 2003</a>; <a href="#Dehouck et al, 2008">Dehouck et al, 2008</a>, <a href="#Werdell and Roesler, 2003">Werdell and Roesler, 2003</a>).
Studies of spectral reflectances of the different seagrass species comparing to the spectra of sand and other seafloor cover types (<a href="#Vahtmae et al, 2006">Vahtmae et al, 2006</a>) prove that spectra of green, brown and red benthic macroalgae differ from each other, as well as from sand and deep water reflectance spectra. These differences are well detectable by the means of the remote sensing research methods. Some authors  (<a href="#Dierssen and Zimmerman, 2003">Dierssen and Zimmerman, 2003</a>) also use spectrally based radiative transfer approach to quantitatively estimate shallow-water bathymetry and leaf area index (LAI) of the seagrass. 
The spectral reflectances in general are the result of the spectral absorption in different bands, typical for each target object. Spectral reflectance of the seagrass is largely influenced by the water depth where it is located, and is generally decreasing in values by increasing depths. The most important spectral diapason for marine mapping of submerged vegetation and, particukarly, for seagrass, is 350-800 nm (<a href="#Barille et al, 2009">Barille et al, 2009</a>). 
Using airborne imagery for retrospective data (before 1970s) together with the most recent imagery allows to detect changes in seagrass distribution on over different years and to analyse dynamics of the seagrass distribution (<a href="#Ball et al, 2009">Ball et al, 2009</a>). Another important advantage of the application of the remote sensing data for mapping of submerged aquatic vegetation has commertial nature: using remote sensing data and methods enables more low-cost and up-to-date seagrass mapping (<a href="#Mumby et al, 1999">Mumby et al, 1999</a>), and is especially useful for the areas where the fieldwork data capturing is unavailable. 
Seagrass meadows may reach spatial scales from several up to hundreds of metres, therefore they are susceptible by the means of satellite imagery from remote sensors, both with moderate resolution  (e.g., Landsat MSS, Landsat TM, Landsat ETM+; MERIS; ASTER, MODIS) and high resolution as well (e.g., IKONOS, Quickbird, SPOT). The possibility of their application towards seagrass mapping vary and is limited by the technical characteristics and resolution of these sensors. In the next sub-paragraphs we briefly discuss the limitations and research experience of the using of various imagery for the seagrass mapping. 
<h1 id="2.4.1. Review of multispectral imagery used for seagrass mapping"><p><b>2.4.1. 	Review of  multispectral imagery used for seagrass mapping</p></b></h1>
Seagrass mapping using remotely sensed data from multispectral sensors is generally based on the classification and discrimination of the seafloor types using their spectral characteristics in different wavebands. 
Perhaps, the most known imagery, widely used in the remote sensing based mapping, is received from the group of Landsat sensors, known for its histirical pioneeer role in the satellite industry. 
Being the longest running satellite system, lunched in 1972, Landsat is the only source of archival data going back to 1984 at a sufficient spatial resolution (<a href="#Dekker et al, 2005">Dekker et al, 2005</a>), which makes its data desirable for historial mapping or environmental analysis of change detection of the seagrass landscapes. 
The Landsat TM and Landsat ETM+ data, with the most recent from sensor Landsat 7, launched in 1999, proved to be feasibile and useful for the mapping of submerged vegetation, such as seagrasses or coral reefs. The successful application of the imagery Landsat TM, an advanced and multispectral scanning, towards the seagrass mapping, was reported in numerous research works (<a href="#Palandro et al, 2003">Palandro et al, 2003</a>; <a href="#Gullstroom et al, 2006">Gullstroom et al, 2006</a>; <a href="#Wabnitz et al, 2008">Wabnitz et al, 2008</a>; <a href="#Bierwirth et al, 1993">Bierwirth et al, 1993</a>; <a href="#Rasib and Hashim, 1997">Rasib and Hashim, 1997</a>; ).
The Landsat data are particularly suitable for the case of change detection of seagrass landscapes at a decadal scale, because being the main sensor onboard the Landsat satellites, Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)  provides the longest time series available for change detection analysis over submerged vegetation (<a href="#Palandro et al, 2003">Palandro et al, 2003</a>)
Another well-known multispectral sensor, SPOT provides multispectral imagery with a spatial resolution of 10 m, covering covers a surface area of 3600 km² (60*60 km swath), 26-day orbital repeat cycle for nadir viewing and imagery with a spatial resolution 20 - 2.5 m (SPOT website). SPOT imagery was used for mapping beds of Posidonia oceanica in the Mediterranean Sea (<a href="#Pasqualini et al, 2005">Pasqualini et al, 2005</a>).
The IKONOS, offering multispectral and panchromatic imagery, was the first to collect publicly available high-resolution imagery at 1- and 4-meter resolution (http://www.geoeye.com). IKONOS imagery has been applied for the seagrass mapping due to its high resolution and accessibility. Thus, the results of image classification in case study of shallow-water marine environment (<a href="#Mumby and Edwards, 2002">Mumby and Edwards, 2002</a>) made using IKONOS, Landsat TM, and CASI, show that in the blue part of the spectrum, the best results are achieved by IKONOS and CASI, while Landsat TM has not high enough resolution. It may be caused to some extent by the loss of the radiance contrast, atmospheric Rayleigh scattering and defects of scattering. However, comparing between CASI and IKONOS, the same authors prove that CASI enable to receive still more accurate results of the the classification than IKONOS (<a href="#Mumby and Edwards, 2002">Mumby and Edwards, 2002</a>). 
Another comparative analysis of the application of CASI, Landsat and Quickbird imagery (<a href="#Phinn et al, 2008">Phinn et al, 2008</a>) demonstrates the high suitability of CASI images for the fine-scale mapping of seagrass landscapes. Thus, CASI and Quickbird-2 images enable to identify even separate seagrass species with small width and heterogeneous nature of the seagrass patches, which could not be detected using  Landsat  TM images with their 30*30m resolution.
Advanced Spectrometer for Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), a a Japanese sensor providing high-resolution images of the Earth in 15 different bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, ranging from visible to thermal infrared light, has separate subsystems for the visible near infrared (VNIR), shortwave infrared (SWIR), and thermal infrared (TIR) wavelength regions with each one having its own onboard calibration (OBC) system, its own telescope with independent pointing and different detector technology (<a href="#Arai and Tonooka, 2005">Arai and Tonooka, 2005</a>). This makes the ASTER imagery expecially suitable for the application towards detailed mapping of surface temperature, emissivity and reflectance of objects and bathymatric elevations as well.
Advanced Spectrometer for Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), launched in 1999 onboard Terra sensor, provides high-resolution images of the Earth in 15 different bands of the
electromagnetic spectrum, ranging from visible to thermal infrared light (Fig. 2.2). It has diverse subsystems for the visible near infrared (VNIR) with 15 m resolution, shortwave infrared (SWIR), and thermal infrared (TIR) wavelength regions (<a href="#Kalinowski and Oliver, 2004">Kalinowski and Oliver, 2004</a>).
For each channel there is separate onboard calibration (OBC) system, telescope with independent pointing and different detector technology (<a href="#Arai and Tonooka, 2005">Arai and Tonooka, 2005</a>). This makes
ASTER imagery expecially suitable for the application towards detailed mapping of surface temperature, emissivity and reflectance of objects and bathymetric elevations as well. Successful application of the ASTER imagery towards mapping of submerged vegetation reported, for example, by <a href="#Hirose et al, 2004">Hirose et al (2004)</a>. Other multispectra images have also been used for the
seagrass interpretation. For example, the success of using imagery from the multispectral airborne scanner Daedalus AADS1268 is reported by Heege et al (2003) where they aim at classification of
macrophytes in shallow waters of the Lake Constance. In regard to the methods chosen for the image interpretation, the supervised classifications proves to be the most worthy in a majority of case studies (<a href="#Palandro et al, 2003">Palandro et al, 2003</a>, <a href="#Peneva et al, 2008">Peneva et al, 2008</a>). While
often methods of the unsupervised classification are used as a tool for classifying submerged object and features on the multispectral images and aerial imagery (<a href="#Fletcher et al, 2009">Fletcher et al, 2009</a>), it still does not
provide common algorithms that can be applied to other images and regions. Thus, the strength of the optical signal coming from the various types of the seafloor is strongly influenced by the effects of the
water column, its depth and chemical properties. Yet methods of the unsupervised classification overleap mixed spectral effects of the water column which shift the real values of the spectra, with the pure reflectance from the benthos; as a result, it may cause significant errors (<a href="#Dierssen and Zimmerman, 2003">Dierssen and Zimmerman, 2003</a>). Therefore, for the accurate assessments of various seafloor cover types, water column depth and its optical properties, methods of supervised classification should be preferably
used as being more suitable in classification and interpretations of imagery. While this and other studies (<a href="#Phinn et al, 2008">Phinn et al, 2008</a>) demonstrated the advantages of the application of multispectral imagery for the spectral discrimination of the seafloor cover types and mapping the submerged landscapes on the basis of pixels classification, the application of data from hyperspectral sensors has better potential due to their higher resolution.
In regard to the methods chosen for the image interpretation, the supervised classifications proves to be the most worthy in a majority of case studies (<a href="#Palandro et al, 2003">Palandro et al, 2003</a>). 
<h1 id="2.4.2. Review of hyperspectral imagery used for seagrass mapping"><p><b>2.4.2. 	Review of  hyperspectral imagery used for seagrass mapping</p></b></h1>
The application of the hyperspectral sensors is most effective and provide more accurate classification results (Fig.2.1.), due to their higher spectral resolution (<a href="#Bharathi et al, 2003">Bharathi et al, 2003</a>) with interval narrows to 10 nanometers, while broadband sensors are limited to the spectral width of ca 150 nm (Fig.2.2.). 
Hyperspectral imagery is acquired through the simultaneous acquisition of images in many narrow, contiguous spectral bands from hyperspectral scanners (mostly) cover the 400-to 2500-nm spectral bands (<a href="#Schmidt and Skidmore, 2003">Schmidt and Skidmore, 2003</a>).
Perhaps, the most advantageous and general characteristics of hyperspectral imagery is its high spectral resolution, desirable for the case of seagrass monitoring. The most suitable scanner fit for detailed seagrass mapping would
cover bands of 550-750 nm and have a spectrum resolution of 5-15 nm (<a href="#Fyfe, 2004">Fyfe, 2004</a>), which exactly characterizes typical airborne and hyperspectral satellite scanners. Important features may be detected in the narrow wavelengths of hyperspectral imagery, while this information can be lost in the broader wavelengths of other sensors. With its 126 spectral bands, HyMap imagery enables to distinguish features of interest, i.e. seagrass types (<a href="#Peneva et al, 2005">Peneva et al, 2005</a>), which is the major advantage of the of hyperspectral data for mapping landscapes of the seagrasses.
While comparing multispectral imagery with airborne hyperspectral, the last one showed higher overall accuracies (<a href="#Phinn et al, 2008">Phinn et al, 2008</a>). Several, regular and narrow (10 nm) spectral bands, specific for hyperspectral imagery, are strong tool enabling to detect even slight and subtle differences in the spectral reflectances between various seafloor types, e.g. different seagrass species at diverse depths, algae, corals, dark-coloured sands or other types of sediments (<a href="#Hochberg et al, 2003">Hochberg et al, 2003</a>).
Therefore, there is great potential of the application of hyperspectral remote sensing imagery towards seagrass mapping at species level, as long as they are distinguishable spectrally which, for example, has been tested in the case study of Australian marine ecosystems by <a href="#Fyfe, 2004">Fyfe (2004)</a>. Application of various
classifications methods, inter alia maximum likelihood, minimum distance and means, towards hyperspectral imagery (<a href="#Peneva et al, 2008">Peneva et al, 2008</a>), combined with fieldwork measurements ensures accurate
mapping results with the maximum likelihood methos producing the best results. Therefore, accurate mapping of the seagrass landscapes and other seafloor types using remote sensing approaches requires application of  high-spatial resolution (higher than 5 m) or hyperspectral imagery.
Comparative analysis of the application of hyperspectral and multispectral imagery towards the seafloor types classification (<a href="#Hochberg and Atkinson, 2003">Hochberg and Atkinson, 2003</a>) demonstrates that coral, seagrasses and sand wery vell distinguishable in their spectra with an overall classification accuracy of 98%.<br>
However, the use of data from various sensors, both hyperspectral and multispectral, are possible and reasonable, as soon as it meets the research specific objective. Thus, the use of multispectral imagery with high spatial resolution is preferable to using hyperspectral medium resolution data in case of mapping benthic vegetation in areas where the spatial heterogeneity is very high (<a href="#Vahtmae and Kutser, 2007">Vahtmae and Kutser, 2007</a>).
<h1 id="3. Materials and methods"><p><b>3. Materials and methods</p></b></h1>
The research is technically based on WASI, for the analysis of spectral signatures, ArcGIS and ENVI software for the processing and analysing of aerial and broadband images, Google Earth and Landsat.  ArcGIS9.3 software is used for the spatial analysis, general mapping and cartographic layout presentation; the raster processing techniques are applied for the detection of seagrass spatial distribution using supervised classification. 
The research data include Google Earth aerial images and scenes from the Landsat TM and ETM+ covering research period of 10 years in the same year time, taken from USGS GloVis, http://glovis.usgs.gov/ , NOAA and http://glcfapp.umiacs.umd.edu . The satellite imagery provides vital information of the most recent changes in P. oceanica within the coastal areas, as well as the condition (poor or destroyed). 
The raster processing includes making mosaic-like covering for the whole research area. The Google Earth images are most appropriate for the detailed mapping than stellite than Landsat or ASTER enabling to produce accurate maps with correct results. Therefore, the main set of images for the current work is Google Earth aerial images. The Landsat images are used for the general overview. Besides aerial and satellite photographs, data acquired during the fieldwork (21 Sep – 11 Oct) are necessary addition to the mapping helping to solve problems of interpretation during the images classification. Therefore, this work includes sampling of the in-situ measurements of the seagrass distribution. 
The sampling stations were located in two candidate places on the northern (Ligaria) and southern (Xerocampus) parts of Crete island, as these regions are well suitable for the seagrass, due to the annual mean water temperatures and geological factors, i.e. seafloor conditions and sediments. The field campaign has been carried out during the September-October period 2010. The information about the location of the seagrass (mostly represented by the P.oceanica species)  is useful for the understanding of the relationship between the spatial distribution of the seagrass and  the environment of the selected areas of Cretan beaches. The results of the videographic measurements are used for the seafloor types detection, because the objects represented on the photos can be well distinguished and classified according to the following well-known characteristics  (<a href="#Butler, 1987">Butler, 1987</a>): size (yet some measurements are necessary for the similar-looking objects); shape (the general form is most reliable evidence for identification); colour (common and reliable object indicator); texture (when changes in tone are too small to be distinguishable, texture may assist identification, e.g., stippled, granular, rough, smooth, etc.); associated features (those usually found near other objects, e.g., rocks & soil).
<h1 id="3.1. Study area"><p><b>3.1. 	Study area</p></b></h1>
General area: Island of Crete, Greece (Fig.3.1.). 
The study area of the current MSc research is located in the shallow areas of the Ligaria beach, Agia Pelagia and Xerocampos, Crete island, Greece. These shelf areas have maximal depth of four meters. Seagrass sampling has been performed at two stations at a depth of 4 meters, in the following selected areas: 
<ol>
<li>Ligaria beach (Agia Pelagia district), 36°20'N 22°59'E
<li>Xerokampos, 35°12'N 26°18'E 
<li>Agia Pelagia, 36°20'N 22°59'E
</ol>
<h1 id="3.2. Fieldwork data collection"><p><b>3.2. 	Fieldwork data collection</p></b></h1>
Seagrass sampling has been performed at two research stations at Crete island - Ligaria beach (36°20'N 22°59'E) and Xerokampos (35°12'N 26°18'E), at depths lesser than 4 meters. The Ligaria Beach is a narrow, sandy and pebble beach (Fig.12), located ca 15 km north-west from Heraklion.
The in-situ measurements were conducted during the fieldwork in the period 21.09.2010-11.10.2010. 
The fieldwork on seagrass monitoring included visual estimations and photo- and video footage of the above-ground seagrass patches, sediment seafloor cover types, species compositions, water depth and geograpic locations recorded using GPS. <br><br>
<h1 id="3.2.1. Fieldwork equipment"><p><b>3.2.1. Fieldwork equipment</p></b></h1>
The research materials and equipment were provided by the Natural History Museum, the University of Crete and the ITC, and included the following items: 1) Boat (Fig.3.3); 2) three iPAQs (Fig.3.5); 3) three GPS (Fig.3.7.); 4) Three underwater video cameras, Olympus ST 8000, suitable for photographing up to up to 33 foot depths and high-resolution 12.0-Mpixel image sensor (Fig.3.4.); 4) Markers and cords for the depths measurements; 5) Waterproof plasctic Otterbox for keeping the iPAQ dry; 6) SCUBA Diving equipment (taken from the Ligaria Diving Centre).
A GPS and iPAQ have been used for detection of the geodetic coordinates and keeping the tracklogs along the boat route for GIS project. <br><br>
<h1 id="3.2.2. Sampling design"><p><b>3.2.2. Sampling design</p></b></h1>
The sampling design of the fieldwork was aimed at surveying of the spatial distribution of the meadows of P. oceanica, and spatial pattern of the seagrass meadows consisted from separate patches. The fieldwork included several routes of the boat in the Ligaria beach sampling site, nine routes in total, in the directions parallel to the coastline, ca 180-200 m long each, thus enabling the course plot to cover the area of growing seagrass: shelf areas not deeper than four meters. 
The measurements of the seafloor cover types have been made using underwater video cameras Olympus ST 8010, mounted under the boat to capture video footage and imagery. The data records were made along each path using these cameras. 
A videographic approach, tested previously (<a href="#Norris et al, 1997">Norris et al, 1997</a>), was applied during the fieldwork on Crete island, for collecting information on benthic cover types and distribution of the seagrass patches from photo transects, in order to use for the calibration of mapping approaches. Three underwater video cameras, located on the bottom of the boat, provided videometric measurements of the seafloor during the track, and resulted in a series of consequent overlapping images of the sea bottom under the boat path. The general locations of the sampling sites and routes were selected on the basis of the visual examination of the seagrass beds during snorkelling and SCUBA diving, recommendations from the Greek collaborators of the Natural Nistory Museum of Crete, and available maps covering the research area. To ensure even and objective selection of sampling sites we used transect sampling method, i.e.  photographs were taken along the research path. Transect method is a common sampling technique in studies of the seagrass monitoring (<a href="#Shortis et al, 2007">Shortis et al, 2007</a>), enabling the occurrences of the seagrass meadows to be recorded and counted in a systematic and accurate way, detect spatial distribution of the single seagrass mattes to be properly identified, without location bias. The videographic measurements and photos, enabling to detect types of the seafloor, were captured by means of underwater digital video cameras Olympus ST 8000 (Fig.3.4), at five minutes interval along the tracklog path (Fig.3.9.). 
The research sampling design also included measurements of depths, because bathymetry is one of the most determinating factors for the seagrass locations.Measurements of depths were performed during the fieldwork using cord, iPAQs, and markers in order to assure that the videometric measurements are taken at depths not more than four meters, in the shelf area (Fig. 3.10). 
As a result, nine transects were established of one m wide and 20 m long track, to cover seagrass beds with videographic measurements. The GPS allowed to capture measurement locations on the iPAQ, encapsulated in a plastic waterproof Otterbox. Camera were adjusted horizontally by a leveller and were mounted under the bottom of the boat to capture video footage and imagery (Fig.3.10). The data were taken at proper weather conditions: sunny, serene and cloud-free days with glassy sea state. The locations of the route were randomly selected in the areas of the Ligaria beach, to ensure most dense coverage of the seagrass meadows in the research area. The underwater measurements of the seagrass coverage were carried out by taking video footage and photos of ca 0.5 m2 size each. 
The results of the underwater videometric measurements include series of digital images helping to classify seafloor cover types and seagrass meadows, according to the differences in the structure, colour, texture and shapes of the depicted objects. 
Along the Ligaria beach there are several types of the seagrass landscapes, namely, segrass meadows continuously covering vast areas (Fig.3.10), aggregated seagrass patches, represented by separate mattes with short irregular channels between them (Fig.3.11) and isolated seagrass patches, or mattes, which located separately from broad meadows (Fig.3.12). 
The results of the underwater videometric measurements of the Olympus cameras made during the ship route include nine total tracklog routes in the selected research area, including series of consequent images, completely covering the area under the boat path. The received data contain information on seagrass presence within the study area, distribution of seagrass P.oceanica meadows and nature of the seafloor cover types (rocks, sandy, mixed). Seagrass species on the Ligaria and Agia Pelagia beach consist of P.oceanica. The types of sediment on the Ligaria vary from coarse sand, P.oceanica patches, sand, mud, rock gravel and fine sand (3.13). <br>

<h1 id="3.4. Google Earth aerial imagery for seagrass mapping"><p><b>3.4.	Google Earth aerial imagery for seagrass mapping</p></b></h1>
Apart from the satellite imagery, the aerial photographs from the Google Earth provide a powerful tool for seagrass mapping, because they are important, reliable, detailed and up-to-date source of imagery. Perhaps, the most clear advantage of the Google Earth imagery is high resolution (15 m in land areas and lower in the oceans). Obtained from the airborne platforms, Google Earth images have general spatial resolution of several meters (though vatying in different areas), which allows very detailed habitat and seafloor types discrimination, comparing with images acquired from the spaceborne satellite platforms. 
The spatial coverage is lesser comparing to spaceborne images, but this can be solved as well: while in general providing smaller area coverage than satellites images, the Google Earth images can be stitched to the composite maps of the acceptable spatial extent, using Google grabbing process which allows multiple overlapping of single images over the flight paths, and generates mosaics.

The remote sensing imagery were collected for the Crete island area covering the research period and area, enabling the field data to be used for the calibration and validation. The available aerial and satellite imagery are commonly used for the mapping of seagrass landscapes and their application is proven by various research papers. The imagery include satellite multi-spectral imagery (Landsat-TM, ETM+) and aerial imagery from the Google Earth. 
The overview of the collected data enables to summarize their following types: 
1. Spectra of P.oceanica and other seafloor types at different environmental conditions
2. Aerial imagery from the Google Earth 
3. Satellite images from the open sources (Landsat)
4. Underwater videometric measurements of the Olympus cameras made during the ship route 	
The available imagery is listed below (Table 1) and new images are read into the ArcGIS project.  
The available broadband and hyperspectral remote sensing data are used for the mapping of the seagrass in shelf areas no deeper than 4.0 meters, for the environmental monitoring in order to detect the dynamics in changes of the seagrass distribution along Crete during the past 10 years using different satellite images for 2000-2010.
The spatial resolution of Landsat ETM+ image is 30 m in the visible and near infrared bands (bands 1-5 and 7); the spatial resolution of ASTER 15 m for the visible and near-infrared bands. IKONOS acquires data in 3 visible channels and NIR, with spatial resolution of 1-4 meters. ASTER and IKONOS images are suggested to be included as soon as available, in addition to the Landsat. The research includes fieldwork in-situ measurements of the seagrass distribution along the northern and south-eastern coasts of Crete in chosen locations.

In-situ measurements
2010/Sep-Oct
 Underwater still imagery and underwater videometric measurements 

The optical measurements of the irradiance and radiance of the sea water and bottom cover types of the seafloor have been received by the means of the optical sensors Trios-RAMSES Hyperspectral UVA/UVB Irradiance Sensor and RAMSES-ARC Hyperspectral UV-VIS Radiance Sensor (Fig.2.3 and 2.4), both adjusted for the measurements of the irradiance and radiance.  
The highest measured values are located in the diapason of 410-730 nm for the water irradiance (Fig.4.2) and 430-650 for the water radiance (Fig.4.3). Afterwards, the measured values of the radiance and irradiance, respectively, have been used for the computation of the spectral reflectance properties of the sea water and bottom cover types (Fig.4.11). 
The spectral range of radiance cover diapason of 320-950 nm, and ittadiance measurements are covered in the interval of 280-500 nm, which is suitable for a characteristics of seagrass reflectance. 
Different curves on the radiance and irradiance graphs (Fig. 4.2 and 4.3) represent several series of the measurements. The values of the spectral reflectance are received from the computations of these values using Excel mathematical formulae. The graphs (Fig. 4.2 and 4.3) show the values of the radiance and irradiance of the sea water in Agia Pelagia, with and without sediments and suspended particles, respectively. 
<h1 id="4.2. Data pre-processing"><p><b>4.2. Data pre-processing</p></b></h1>
A collection of visible spectra of two seafloor cover types - P.oceanica and carbonatic sand - were tested for the spectral variability and separability under varying conditions of dfifferent environmental constituents (e.g. depth, water content, sun angle etc), in order to determine the potential that it may have on the approaches for further images processing and classification.The raw initial data of measurements of the spectral reflectance have been pre-processed and analysed. These data have been measured using different step of the wavebands: some measurements were made with 3 nm interval, while others – using 4 and 1 nm step. Therefore, these data had to be interpolated and standardized to one format, which is values of spectral reflectancese with one nm step. For the interpolation we used script written on Python programming language that allowed to receive more detailed data by interpolating them from 3 and 4 nm step up to 2 nm (Fig.4.4).  
The interpolated data contained spectral measurements of the seagrass P.oceanica (measured at Agia Pelagia beach, Crete), sand (measured at Agia Pelagia beach, Crete), silt and default  artificial spectrum of constant albedo at WASI.  We included measurements of the Thalassia seagrass (measured at Southern Chinese Sea by D.Yang) for the comparison of the spectral reflectances of different seagrass speciea under various environmental conditions.
The most suitable wavebands for the seagrass monitroring usually lay between 400 and 700 nm, which can be concluded by the visual examination, comparison and analysis of the different spectra of the seagrasses (Fig.). Therefore, we chosen the spectra 400-750 as the most appropriate range for further  research experiment.
The results of the linear interpolation (Fig.4.5) show the values of the sand spectral reflectances with 1 nm interval covering the wavelength diapason of 400-750 nm. 
<h1 id="4.3. Analysis of spectral signatures"><p><b>4.3. Analysis of spectral signatures</p></b></h1>
The distinguishing spectral signatures for various seafloor types (e.g. seagrass species, coral reefs, various types of sand,  mud, other sediments) exist in well-defined and narrow (10–20 nm) wavelength ranges.  The values of their spectral reflectance are accepted as constant. The results of spectral measurements enable to analyse, whether P.Oceanica is spectrally distinct from other sea floor types with changing environmental conditions, using the differences in their spectral signatures on the graphs in a WASI, the Water Colour Simulator software. The Water Colour Simulator WASI, a software tool for analysing and simulating the most common types of spectra (<a href="#Gege, 2005">Gege, 2005</a>), is highly suitable for the seagrass spectral analysis. 
There are several environmental characteristics which influence the results of water spectral reflectance, amongst which different bottom depths, concentration of suspended particles in water column, water temperature, sun angle, concentration of gelbstoff (coloured dissolved organic matter), concentration of phytoplankton, aerosol scattering, exponent of backscattering by small particle (<a href="#Gege, 2004">Gege, 2004</a>). The backward-scattering coefficient (bb), also included in WASI, is a
fundamental optical property which plays a central role in the ocean-color remote sensing, providing the remotely sensed optical signal, as well as suspended particle distributions, water clarity, and
underwater visibility (<a href="#Maffione and Dana, 1997">Maffione and Dana, 1997</a>). WASI enables simulation of backscattering of pure water, large and small particles. The values of all these parameters can be redacted and changed
manuall. However, the most important, major factors affecting the in-situ conditions are water depth and cover fraction of the seafloor types: P.oceanica and carbonatic sand. Seagrass P.oceanica can be mapped using remotely acquired spectral imagery, if it has distinctive reflectance signatures at different depths. Therefore, the depths of the shelf area are the first variable condition for this research question. The depths values chosen for the current research are lesser than 3.5 meters, covering shelf zone, and providing the best enironmental conditions for the seagrass P.oceanica: 0.5, 2.0 and 3.5 meters with an interval of 1.5 meters. The 3.5 m depth limit was chosen based on the analysis of the separability of seagrass reflectance signatures, received by the means of previous in-situ measurements (year 2009) of the radiance and irradiance of water in Agia Pelagia bay, which indicated that P.oceanica seagrass could be only well separated within depths of 3.5 m. 
A statistical analysis of WASI-simulated spectral reflectance has been used in order to answer the first research question: whether the P.oceanica spectra is spectrally distinct at varying environmental in-situ conditions, and if P. Oceanica remains spectrally distinct with the increasing water column depth. 
To answer this research question, different seafloor cover types are discriminated using data of the broadband remote sensing. The results enable to study reflectance properties of the seagrass and other seafloor types. Application of the optical radiative transfer model WASI is suggested to simulate remote sensing sensors (MODIS, ASTER, SPOT, MERIS, Landsat TM). 
In order to focus on the factors of primar importance, other and less influencing factors are excluded, i.e. sun angle, concentration of the suspected particles in the water column, content of gelbstoff, etc. For these factors default values of WASI are accepted.<br>
Under normal conditions by independent water colour sampling, values of the remote-sensing reflectance can vary by 12–24% (<a href="#Toole et al, 2000">Toole et al, 2000</a>), and these variations in the radiometric determinations are mainly caused by the variety of the environmental factors. 
Different factors influence colour and spectral reflectance of water, among which different bottom depths, concentration of suspended particles in water column, water temperature, sun angle, concentration of gelbstoff (coloured dissolved organic matter), concentration of phytoplankton, aerosol scattering, exponent of backscattering by small particles, cloudness, viewing geometry and wind speed (which is, however, not the major source of uncertainty). All these environmental components increase the absorbtion and scattering of light which, in its turn, results in a complex relationship between their concentrations and the radiance of water that finally influence its spectral reflectance. 
However, although there are a variety of environmental factors that contribute to the spectral reflectance, the most important ones from the mentioned above are water depth and seafloor fraction. It is because spectra of the seagrass P.oceanica vary qualitatively over the depths interval of 0.5–4 m, and secondly, the content and cover fraction of the seafloor have the most distinctive effect on the spectral reflectance of the water. 
Therefore, in current MSc research we focus on these two major factors, and study the response of the water reflectance towards changing conditions of the water column depth and seafloor bottom cover fraction (seagrass P.oceanica, carbonate sand and silt). 
The analysis of the spectral signatures of the seagrass and sand clearly shows (Fig.13) that seagrass has spectral reflectance much lesser than that of a carbonate sand, in general not increasing values of 10 % reflectance in spectra of 500-600 nm, while sand has spectral reflectance approaching 33% in its highest values. 
<h1 id="4.3.1. Water color spectral simulation using WASI"><p><b>4.3.1. Water color spectral simulation using WASI</p></b></h1>
The main aim of this part of research is to clarify if the bottom reflectance of the different seafloor types including patches of the seagrass P.oceanica meadows, silt and carbonate sand differ and can be clearly discriminated while mapping. A study is based on three seafloor types containing silt, carbonate sand and seagrass, as well as mixed types, where the spectral signatures were examined.
WASI software (Fig.4.3.) is used to simulate spectral reflectance and colour discrimination of water, affected by presence of P.Oceanica and other factors, under various environmental conditions which influence its colour. The data provided with the model was determined at freshwater of the Boddensee (<a href="#Gege, 2005">Gege, 2005</a>), yet the model was adjasted for the marine environment, so that its parameters (concentration of chlorophyll, concentration of small particles, yellow substance, etc) now perfectly simulate the Mediterranean water conditions.

The remote sensing reflectance has been compared under the conditions of different water depths and cover fraction of the seafloor, in order to assess spectral signatures of the seagrass and carbonate sand as major seafloor types. WASI enables to use forward or inverse calculation for the spectrum types at a diapason of 350-800 nm with a 1nm spectral resolution. For the spectral analysis we applied forward calculations, which is a computing and plotting of series of spectra according to specified parameter settings, with exactly defined depths and cover fraction. 
The specific parameters chosen for the simulation of the environmengal conditions where seagrass grow. The adaptations to life in salt sea water requires various phisical and chemical parameters which include salinity, temperature of 17-25°C, light requirements with 10-20% on average, ranging from 4.4% minimal up to 29% (<a href="#McKenzie and Yoshida, 2009">McKenzie and Yoshida, 2009</a>), so that the zenith angle is taken as 35-45° and reflection factor 0.0201.

Although seagrass P.oceanica can be found until depth limits down to 40 m depth (<a href="#Hartog, 1970">Hartog 1970</a>), the most preferrable limits of its distribution in the Mediterranean Sea are shallow waters until 4 meters of depth. The increase of depths (zB) influences weakening of light and thus directly affects production of chlorophyll, because when light passes through the water and suspended particles, it is being largely modifed through the absorption and scattering before it finally reaches plant canopy of the seagrass. Therefore, the most healthy and suitable areas for the seagrass grow are located at depths lesser than 4 meters. 
An analysis of the spectral reflectances of P. oceanica.is done using the WASI simulations in order to determine, which wavebands can be still used to identify P. oceanica. The analysis of spectra shows that the appropriate wavebands for seagrass mapping lay between 500 and 600 nm (Fig.16) and has also peaks at around 700 nm, ca between 680 and 710 nm (Fig.16). The highest values of the bottom reflectance are at spectra of 500-600 nm. The most appropriate depths at which the spectral signatues could still be discrtiminated for seagrass are lesser than 2.5 meters.
The remote sensing properties of the broad-band satellite sensors are often limited and do not allow easy and unique discrimination of seagrass from other seafloor tyeps. Therefore, we focus on narrow-band spectra with the resolution of 1 nm.

The patches of white sandy bottoms of the seafloor, studied in the fieldwork in Ligaria beach, are much brighter than mattes of P.Oceanica (Fig.11: bottom types in Ligaria), which can be clearly seen at the graph showing the values of the spectral reflectance of the carbonate sand and than that of P. oceanica (Fig.10). The graph is received in excel table using mean values of spectral reflectances of sand and seagrass, respectively, which have been calculated from measurements of radiance and irradiance received in Agia Pelagia bay.

The in situ spectral reflectance data of P.oceanica and sand were used to model these seafloor cover types as the different sensors would percept them: MODIS, ASTER, MERIS, SeaWiFS and CZCS. These models simulate spectral views of the chosen sensors, how they will "see" seagrass and sand as pixels, with accepted default atmosphere and water column effects (given by WASI software). In such a way we defined an empirical upper limit to the discriminative potential of these sensors. To create these sensor-specific reflectance spectra, spectral responses of each of these sensor were applied for the spectral signature of seafloor cover types in full-resolution spectra (Fig. 4.13-4.16)
<h1 id="4.4. Image processing using Erdas Imagine"><p><b>4.4. Image processing using Erdas Imagine</p></b></h1>
The analysis of the imagery of Cretan coasts is based on the images classification and is aimed to investigate the distribution of the seagrass P.oceanica within the research area. 
In the image processing part of the research supervised classification has been applied to the aerial and satellite images. Seagrass meadows and other seafloor cover types were evaluated through a detailed examination of the imagery. Seagrass beds are clearly visible in color aerial Google Earth photographs, contrasting against slightly-yellow and browny sand bottom. The seagrass areas are detected using different bands combinations, masked and studied for the estimation of the changes in the areas. The classification is based on the spectral properties of the P.oceanica, such as brightness, colour, texture and structure of the seagrass mattes (Fig. 4.17, 4.18). The raster-based mapping includes supervised classification with training sites of seagrasses (10-15 set areas) in different bands for each photograph by classification a series of polygons characteristic of each of the sea floor bottom types: sandy surface, seagrass bed for each species including P.oceanica (meadows), patchy seagrass bed and algae on rock, rocks, muddy surface, etc (Fig.4.19).  
On the basis of the image processing and classification, applied to the northern coats of Crete, the marine bottom types between 10 m depth has been mapped, including the limit depths of the of the seagrass meadows provided on the basis of the available and collected field data. The classification has been completed using ENVI and Erdas Imagine software.

The integrated approach used in this research work has high potential as a means to monitor changes in seagrass landscape occurring in a shallow waters over Crete area. It encompasses the integration of
high resolution aerial color Google Earth photography, spaceborne satellite imgery, assessment of spectral signatures using WASI software, image processing by means of Erdas Imagine and Arc GIS based mapping. The use of GIS for data intergration, storage, analyses, visualizing and mapping enables to analyse environmental changes within seagrass landscapes based on data from various
sources: aerial and satellite images, geographically referenced maps of Crete island and results of images classification showing areas of seagrass distribution. The final mapping has been supported in ArcGIS through the data exporting, conversion and integration of various data in one GIS-project (Fig.23). Data collected during the fieldwork, imagery of the seagrass distribution are added into a GIS dataset for the assessment and spatial analysis. 
<h1 id="4.5.2. Upscale mapping of seagrass landscapes"><p><b>4.5.2. Upscale mapping of seagrass landscapes</p></b></h1>
Although ocean pelagic landscapes have a high degree of spatial variance and less structurally complex, comparing to the terrestrial ones, the landscape-level phenomena have similar features, and there are accepted definitions of landscapes elements within the seagrass meadows (<a href="#Robbins and Bell, 1994">Robbins and Bell, 1994</a>). In general, the structure of seagrass landscape is more simplier than that of the terrestrial ecosystems in biodiversity and complexity, however, seagrass landscapes show variation in spatial patterns over different spctial scales. Complexity of the landscape of seagrass meadow show the measure of patches in size and shape, expressed in ratio of patch perimeter to area. The fragmentation of the seagrass landscapes is expressed in contiguity displaying patch aggregation within meadows.  
The general principles of the hierarchy within the seagrass landscapes are based upon the quantitative analysis of the spatial patterns, consisted by components and separate elements. Thus, the bunches of individual shoots construct patches, the first hierarchical level. Patches are arranged into discrete clumps of mattes (at a scale of centimeters to meters) which, in turn, make up beds with l-100m in diameter. Finally, seagrass beds, are arranged into meadows that may extend over kilometer-wide areas, historically defined as landscapes (<a href="#Robbins and Bell, 1994">Robbins and Bell, 1994</a>). Besides spatial structure of the seagrass meadows, there are strong and complex patterns of depth zonation, specific fo individual seagrass species, but such detailed clasiification goes beyond the scope of the current MSc research. 
Unique feature of seagrass meadows, most characteristic for shallow areas, is dynamics of their landscapes. Homogeneous, continuous seagrass meadows can reach in size up to 40 m2, however they are often interrupted by gaps and channels of open spaces generated by the complex, disturbin sedimentation processes, turbulence and turbidity regime of waters and landscape dynamics, which form gaps and channels within meadows, making them “patchy-looking”, i.e. diversified by separate mattes (Fig.4.12). The traditional definition for gap in vegetation cover is “disturbance-generated openings in either floral or faunal cover” (<a href="#Connell, 1978">Connell, 1978</a>). Formation and increase of these gaps within the mosaic of seagrass meadows is caused by different reasons. The most probable drivers for the process of gaps formation within seagrass meadows are removal of interior vegetation, differential growth of seagrass meadows and increased sedimentation. Thus, storms lead to severe deposition of sediments, burying parts of seagrass meadow, the same effect has movements and deposition of sediments during and after floods (<a href="#Bell et al, 1999">Bell et al, 1999</a>). 
Increased nutrient sedimentation, expecially phosphorus, were explored (<a href="#Jensen and Bell, 2001">Jensen and Bell, 2001</a>) as a potential mechanism for increasing patch dynamics and morphological plastisity within seagrass
meadows. Another factor increasing the degree of fragmentation of the landscapes of P.oceanica meadows is the invasion of alien species, such as Cymodocea nodosa, Caulerpa prolifera, Caulerpa taxifolia.  Invaders are in general strong colonizers comparing to native P.oceanica: they occupy much greater habitat space within the regressed meadows of stressed native seagrass (<a href="#Montefalcone et al, 2010">Montefalcone et al, 2010</a>). However, on the northern coasts of Crete the only dominating seagrass species is P.oceanica.
Morphological differences in scale of seagrass landscape formations, discussed above, cause need for the different-scale mapping. Therefore, the investigation of the seagrass meadows at different levels is performed using underwater videometric measurements, aerial and satellite imagery.

The suggested methodology of the analysis of seagrass adaptation towards different environments of the coastal zones can be applied to other marine coastal areas with growing seagrass.
More than 50% of the world population lives within one km of the coast which results in continued anthropogenic pressures in coastal regions. Therefore, management of coastal resources and shelf zone protection in the Mediterranean Sea become increasingly important and require large-scale monitoring and mapping of the shelf zone as vital instrument for the environmental assessment.
